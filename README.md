# Tron_Multiplayer
A multiplayer version of Tron using python.  

# About
I am using this project as a way of testing a multiplayer game engine I am creating using python, PodSixNet, and Pygame.  
The engine aims to make writing multiplayer games as simple as possible.  It is currently meant only for LAN games. 
The Tron Game itself will support up to four player playing at once, and have the option to play alongside AI's.
